# Module1
In this Module we aimed to  write the basic code in Python using Numpy and Pandas after we load and analyze the given data.
Once we loaded  the IRIS dataset in Pandas Dataframe we performed the tasks of cleaning, processing  and removing the missing or null values.
We also generated statistical summaries for all the columns that have numeric values.
The summaries include: Mean, Median, Standard Deviation.
In the next step by using Numpy we transformed that data for further analysis
